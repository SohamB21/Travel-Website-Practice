# Travel-Website-Practice

This is a simple travel website form that allows users to enter their name, age, gender, email, phone number, and desired travel locations. The form is submitted to the index.php file using the POST method. The index.php file then connects to a MySQL database and inserts the submitted data into a table called traveller_details.
